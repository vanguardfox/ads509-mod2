In the case of this sample text test, the assert allows the descriptive_stats function to assume or force the value of each of its expected output fields where only to standard output will the statement with verbose print the descriptive statistics. If there conditional inside the assert statement evaluates to false, then an error would be raised to help identify where to correct possible vulnerable logic."

As I am using the default corpus containing songs from Cher and Robyn, I am not familiar with either of their works. I would assume a priori that artists with a corpus of older songs would have more diversity due to the relative ubiquity of the internet that might make newer songs more similar or with more repeated token usage and patterns of use.
